# Lexus Catalog RAG
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer user questions about Lexus SUV vehicles based only on official product catalogs and brochures.Instead of relying on a language model’s internal knowledge, the system retrieves relevant sections from a curated document corpus and generates answers grounded in the retrieved evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving traceability.

The project demonstrates a production-style RAG architecture with:
- document chunking
- vector search
- metadata-aware retrieval
- LLM-based answer generation
- citation-ready outputs
